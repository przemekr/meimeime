MeiMeiMe, helps you to take cool pictures without pressing any button!\n\n
      
Just keep the application in background, make sure the screen is on (if
it is not, just press the power button and wait one second), then make a
fast, smooth move, streching your arm, then hold the phone still for two
seconds. You should hear the countdown beep and the camera shellter when
the picture is taken.\n\n

Enjoy!
